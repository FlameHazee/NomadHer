<b>B-Importing and building Section</b> <br>
1-Install Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2- Install the Expo CLI command line utility: npm install -g expo-cli
3-Import the project folder . (In case you don't know how the command is 'git clone https://github.com/hagerhaf/nomadher.git ')
4-Using the command line,go to the nomadher directory.
5-Using the command line,run the project either with :

npm start
OR
exp start
OR
expo start

6-If the building goes fine,a QR code will be generated.

7-The QR code is the 'identifiyer' of your application version,So scan it using the Expo application that you download.

8-The app will recognize the QR code and run the corresponding project.

9-You can visualize in real time in your device the changes that you make to your project files everytime you click 'save'.



<b>C-Files presentation</b> <br>
1-In this repository you will find a file called 'App.js'.This will be our main project page.For the sake of analogy,it is to React Native what index.php is to PHP project.

2-Open the 'App.js' file and replace line 3 with the page you want to visualize/test.For instance if I want to test my 'Chatroom.js' page,I go to 'App.js' file and write 'import Chatroom from './pages/Chatroom';' and replace line 11 with <Chatroom/>.

3-You will create and test the required pages in directory 'pages'.This is where you can find the other pages like Signup and Login...
